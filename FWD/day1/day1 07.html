    <h1>Glossary on  full stack web development</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Full Stack :</h2>
        </li>
        <p> A software development approach that includes both frontend and backend development.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> In this example, the developer creates both the frontend and backend components of a web application. They may use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and a programming language like Python or Ruby for the backend. The developer then integrates these components to create a functional web application.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Frontend :</h2>
        </li>
        <p>The user-facing side of the application, including the interface, user interactions, and client-side processing.
            </p>
        
        <li>
            <h2>HTML :</h2>
        </li>
        <p> A markup language used to structure the content on the web.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this example, the developer uses HTML to create the structure of a web page. They may create a header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>CSS :</h2>
        </li>
        <p>A stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this example, the developer uses CSS to style the web page created with HTML. They may define the colors, fonts, and layout for the various elements of the web page.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Java Script :</h2>
        </li>
        <p>A scripting language that allows you to create dynamic and interactive websites.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this example, the developer uses JavaScript to add interactivity to the web page. They may create a script that updates the content of a section of the web page or implements a feature that allows users to submit feedback.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Backend :</h2>
        </li>
        <p>The server-side of the application, including database management, business logic, and server-side processing.
        </p>
        <li>
            <h2>React:</h2>
        </li>
        <p>A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
        </p>
        <ul><li>In this example, the developer uses React to create the frontend of a web application. They may use React components to build the structure and appearance of the web page, and incorporate React's state management features to add interactivity to the web page.
            </li></ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Node.js: </h2>
            </li>
            <p>An open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In this example, the developer uses Node.js to run a JavaScript script on the server-side. They may use Node.js to create a backend application that interacts with a database to retrieve and store data.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    <h2>Angular:</h2>
                </li>
                <p>A powerful, modern web framework used to build dynamic, interactive, and high-performance web applications.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> In this example, the developer uses Angular to create a full-featured, single-page web application. They may use Angular components to build the structure and appearance of the web page, and Angular services to fetch and manage data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <p> A structured set of data held in a computer or other electronic device, consisting of fields, records, and often indices or keys.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In this example, the developer uses a database to store and manage the data of their web application. They may create tables to define the structure of the data, and they may use SQL queries to perform operations on the data stored in the database.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>

                <ul>
                    <li> In this example, the developer creates an API that allows other applications to access and manipulate the data and functionality of their web application. They may use API endpoints to define the routes and methods that can be accessed, and they may implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to the API.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>

                <ul>
                    <li> In this example, the developer uses Ruby on Rails to create a web application that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. They may use Ruby on Rails' built-in features and tools to quickly build a fully functional web application.
                    </li>
                </ul>
