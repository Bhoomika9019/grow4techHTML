    <img src="./vivo.webp" width="300">
    <p>As of my last update in January 2022, there wasn't a VIVO Y35 model available. VIVO frequently releases new models, so if the VIVO Y35 has been released after that, <br>
        I might not have the details.

        Could you provide more context or check the specific features you're interested in for the VIVO Y35, so I can help you better?</p>

This includes a 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens, an 8MP telephoto lens, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP monochrome lens. The front of the device houses an 8MP selfie camera with AI beauty effects.</li>
